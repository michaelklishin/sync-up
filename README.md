# What is Sync Up

SyncUp is a yet another tiny tool that updates multiple
repositories (Git and Mercurial).


## Usage

SyncUp is unlikely to be of interest to many, so it's not currently published
to NPM.

To install from Git:

    git clone git://github.com/michaelklishin/syncup.git
    cd syncup
    npm install
    npm link

Usage:

    sync-up [path to directory with DVCS repositories]
